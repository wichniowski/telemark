# Telemark.io

Telemark.io is a drone instrument and crowd sourced radio for atmospheres and
noises. The Application was build using the Webaudio API and React. Start by
setting up a synth rack adding as many oscillators your browser can handle and
explore the sonic universe of low frequency oscillation, waveshaping and reverb.
If you found the right setting hit the red dot on the top right to record your
drone. Hit it one more time to stop your recording and head over to the radio to
listen to your and all other drones created with Telemark.
